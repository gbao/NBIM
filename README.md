NBIM Offshore Wind Investment & Cashflow Tracker

A focused, public dataset and live dashboard tracking Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM) participation in offshore wind — combining deal‑level investments with reported cash flows.

Mission: Provide a transparent, well‑sourced view of NBIM’s offshore wind equity investments and NBIM‑reported cash flows related to unlisted renewable energy infrastructure, enabling practitioners and researchers to analyze how long‑horizon, risk‑averse capital supports project bankability and economics.


Why NBIM, why now

NBIM is a long‑horizon, risk‑aware investor. Its participation is often associated with stronger governance, clearer risk allocation, and improved bankability for offshore wind projects, which can support more competitive financing terms. This repository assembles verifiable, NBIM‑only data on investments and reported cash flows so others can analyze these effects transparently.
